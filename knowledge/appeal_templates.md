       Policy Number: [POLICY_NUMBER]
       Patient Name: [PATIENT_NAME]
       Date of Admission: [ADMISSION_DATE]

महोदय/महोदया,

I am writing to formally appeal the rejection of the above-referenced claim. The rejection letter dated [REJECTION_DATE] states that the claim was denied due to Pre-Existing Disease (Code: [REJECTION_CODE]).

I respectfully disagree with this decision for the following reasons:

1. WAITING PERIOD COMPLETED
[If applicable: The policy was purchased on [POLICY_START_DATE], and the hospitalization occurred on [ADMISSION_DATE], which is more than 48 months after policy inception. The waiting period for pre-existing diseases has been completed.]

2. MORATORIUM PERIOD EXCEEDED (Section 45)
[If applicable: As per Section 45 of the Insurance Act, 1938 and IRDAI Circular IRDAI/HLT/REG/CIR/256/11/2020, no claim can be rejected on grounds of non-disclosure after 8 years of continuous coverage. My policy has been active since [ORIGINAL_POLICY_DATE].]

3. NOT A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION
[If applicable: The condition [DISEASE_NAME] was first diagnosed on [FIRST_DIAGNOSIS_DATE], which is after the policy inception date. I have attached medical records proving this is not a pre-existing condition.]

4. CONDITION WAS UNKNOWN
[If applicable: At the time of purchasing the policy, I was not aware of this condition. The first symptoms appeared only after the policy was in force.]

REQUESTED ACTION:
I request you to review my claim and reverse the rejection decision. As per IRDAI guidelines, the claim should be settled within 30 days of receiving all documents.

DOCUMENTS ENCLOSED:
1. Copy of rejection letter
2. Policy document
3. Medical records showing first diagnosis date
4. Discharge summary
5. All hospital bills
6. Doctor's certificate

Please respond to this appeal within 15 days as per IRDAI guidelines. If not resolved, I shall be constrained to approach the Insurance Ombudsman and IGMS portal.

महोदय/महोदया,

विषय: Appeal - Cashless Claim Rejection / Pre-Authorization Denial
       Claim No.: [CLAIM_NUMBER]
       Policy No.: [POLICY_NUMBER]
       Hospital: [HOSPITAL_NAME]

महोदय/महोदया,

My cashless claim/pre-authorization request was rejected citing [REJECTION_REASON]. I am appealing this decision.

CIRCUMSTANCES OF ADMISSION:

[OPTION A - Emergency Admission]
This was an EMERGENCY admission. I was brought to the hospital on [DATE] with symptoms of [SYMPTOMS]. As per IRDAI guidelines, emergency admissions do not require prior authorization. The rejection on grounds of no pre-authorization is incorrect.

[OPTION B - Pre-Auth Was Obtained]
Pre-authorization WAS obtained for this admission. The authorization reference number is [AUTH_NUMBER] dated [AUTH_DATE]. Please verify your records and process the claim accordingly.

[OPTION C - TPA Delay]
I/Hospital sent pre-authorization request on [DATE] but did not receive response within the IRDAI mandated timeline of 1 hour for planned/2 hours for emergency. The delay is on your end, and the claim should not be rejected for this reason.

[OPTION D - Convert to Reimbursement]
If cashless cannot be processed, please convert this to a reimbursement claim and process accordingly. All bills and documents are enclosed.

IRDAI REFERENCE:
As per IRDAI (Health Insurance) Regulations, 2016:
- Pre-authorization response: 1 hour for planned, 2 hours for emergency
- Emergency claims cannot be denied for lack of pre-authorization
- Settlement: Within 30 days of document submission

DOCUMENTS ENCLOSED:
1. Pre-authorization request copy
2. Hospital admission records
3. All medical documents
4. Final bill

Please process this claim within IRDAI mandated timelines. Non-compliance will be reported to IGMS portal.
